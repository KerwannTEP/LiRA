Linear Response of Arms

## Aim of the code

This code aims to compute the growth rate of the arms of a thin Kuzmin-Toomre galactic disc, influence by the presence of two Toomre sphere potential modeling a central bulge and a surrounding dark matter halo.

## Modeling

Following Aoki et al (1979), we consider thin disk made of polytropic gas with index 4/3, which gives analytical expression for the response matrix elements.
The implementation of the bulge component and of the self-gravity parameter slightly modify those matrix elements, which we implement in this semi-analytical code.
